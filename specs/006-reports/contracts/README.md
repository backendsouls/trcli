# Contracts: Activity Reports

The interfaces this specification exposes to users and scripts. Each file is the contract
for one group of commands; changing one after release is a breaking change.

Shared rules — grammar, global options, verbs every record has, output forms, and exit
codes — are in the [CLI conventions](../../000-foundation/contracts/cli-conventions.md) and are not repeated in each file.

| Commands | Contract | Covers |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `trcli report` | [cli-report.md](./cli-report.md) | User Stories 1 to 6; FR-001 to FR-044 |
